       " Row(asin='B000FA64PK', helpful='[0, 0]', overall='3', reviewText=\"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.\", reviewTime='03 15, 2012', reviewerID='A3SZMGJMV0G16C', reviewerName='\"Andrew Pruette \"\"Rancors Love to Read\"\"\"', summary='Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced', unixReviewTime='1331769600', tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0, diff_TB=False, diff_VA=False),\n",

The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.\", reviewTime='08 25, 2008', reviewerID='A3SZMGJMV0G16C', reviewerName='\"Andrew Pruette \"\"Rancors Love to Read\"\"\"', summary=\"Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee\", unixReviewTime='1219622400', tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0, diff_TB=False, diff_VA=False),\n",

I went in with skeptical eyebrow raised - how could these elements work together? The eyebrow forgot to be skeptical halfway through the first page. From the first scene, with Raphael's desperate, lonely voyeurism, to the last, the reader is sucked into this dual world Ms. March has created for us.In order for the story to work convincingly, there are two parallel societies existing side by side. The strictly controlled manners and mores of Regency England stifle Aleric and keep Raphael isolated, while the libertine, violent nature of London's vampire society leaves Raphael feeling hollow and empty, and threatens them both. On the surface, neither one of our heroes are upright citizens, both of them guilty of debauched behavior and self-indulgence. But their failings are more a product of frustration and loneliness, of needing what society tells them is unthinkable.This is told in deep third person POV, with only Raphael and Aleric's thoughts, thus limiting distractions as is necessary in such a short piece. There are fragments and bits of sentences, but in such a deeply embedded viewpoint, these lend a natural, conversational flow to the piece. If I have one nit to pick on this one, it is, indeed, the length. The emotions, the detailed world of the other London, unfold so carefully. When the end comes, it feels rushed and abrupt. We do reach resolution but the release of dramatic tension, the feeling of at least temporary safety one wants for characters to which one feels so attached, was missing.Ending aside, my heart went out to Raphael, so convinced he is cold and soulless, (he is anything but) and to Aleric, so abruptly thrust into a life where he feels out of control and constantly off balance. I did fear for my hard drive during the sex scenes, expecting smoke at any moment, and the stripped-down, character-driven plot moves along at a nice gallop. My hope is that the feeling of incompletion at the end means we will see more of these two. Please don't make us beg, Ms. March.\", tone_overall=1.0, tone_TB=-1.0, tone_VA=-1.0),\n",

I already knew the story would be hot, and I couldn't wait to see what surprises were in store. Unfortunately, while the sex sizzled (as I knew it would), I found myself rather disappointed in this offering.When you meet Alexa and Eric (familiar names if you've read the previous books), you can sense their attraction. The only problem is Eric is gay and in a relationship. After they share a steamy kiss, Eric returns home to his boyfriend Brandon and reveals he was not only turned on, but for the first time he would consider having sex with a woman. Brandon, a bi-sexual man, is intrigued by the idea of witnessing his lover with a woman. The men decide to invite Alexa into their bed to spice things up. What they don't expect is the way she turns their lives upside down as a consequence.At first, the story worked. I got the chemistry, the tension, and the heat between the three. Then the book took a turn that was unexpected and, in my opinion, unbelievable. It's so difficult in reviews to refrain from telling too much and giving the story away. Without going into details I'm only able to provide this: the end of the story just didn't work for me. Had things played out differently or more time had been devoted to developing the characters, maybe it would have. As it was I left the story feeling as if the sex was great but the plot, motivations of the characters, and overall outcome was a way to provide a HEA and wrap the story up.On the plus side, the writing, as with any Karen Erickson work, sizzles.

As a fan of Laurann Dohner's Cyborg series, I couldn't wait to meet her shifters. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. Her alpha heroes are just that - alpha - while her heroines are the perfect foil to bring them to their knees.Mika and Grady are not a conventional couple. She's a human who was adopted into a werewolf family and, though she knows of their existence, is off limits to them. He's a half-breed who has seen the adverse effects of being born in between the two worlds and is determined not to mate with a human as a result. When a brawl forces Grady to mark Mika for her protection, things quickly go downhill. While their chemistry is off the charts, their emotions and fear to connect with each other make this story one hell of a roller coaster ride.At first, the tension worked for me. Although Grady is alpha to the core and refuses to be swayed in his thinking, he also has moments of tenderness. Likewise, while Mika can be soft and nurturing, she can also be tough as nails and refuses to back down. Unfortunately, after a while, their relationship began to border on toxic. As a lover of an unrelenting alpha, Grady's treatment became too much for even me. I felt this was due to the fact that the story is told from Mika's point of view, which doesn't give the reader the opportunity to understand Grady, his feelings, or his motivations. There were several scenes I had difficulty finishing, forcing me to push through to the end. While there is a happily-ever-after, I wasn't convinced of it, and questioned Mika's reasoning for staying with a man who treated her so cruelly, without any regard for her as an equal.On a positive note, the sex scenes are burn-your-fingers hot. Ms. Dohner knows how to create and stoke sexual tension, and she uses her talent to the fullest here. I might not have cared for Grady all that much, but I can't deny that when he and Mika get together they certainly know how to turn up the heat.

Then Shale leaves with Allison, his literary agent. He never returns.Granny is dying and Robin tries to find Shale. Despite the blizzard-like conditions Robin drives up to his remote location where she finds a bizarre situation.Shale is bound by his promise to Allison who died in a horrible car crash. For reasons he is unwilling to expose, he has taken on the responsibility for Ivy, Allison's sister. Occasionally Ted, Allison's husband, appears at the house and Robin's arrival coincides with one of these visits. What is the danger Shale hints at? Why does he want Robin to leave immediately despite the nasty weather?This story is well written and I felt the inner turmoil of its characters. As I read the words I could see the scene unfold before my eyes. Shale, the dark and brooding male. Ivy, the slightly insane woman who has a hidden hold on him. Ted, the affluent businessman immaculately dressed. Robin, the bemused woman who find herself in the midst of all this chaos and madness. Only her faith and her strong love for Shale gives Robin the strength to keep trying.The questions arising from these characters are not easily answered. As each part of the story unfolds, another question takes its place. This is an intriguing book and I truly felt as if I was peeling the petals from a flower, discovering another layer beneath. I was intrigued as to why Shale couldn't leave, wanted to shake Robin and tell her to go, the man wasn't worth it. Robin's perseverance and faith kept everything together and when she took a wrong turn, things start to go horribly wrong.Definitely a book to read.

Well, it is an old necklace, and not only that, there are rumors that the necklace carries a curse. Of course people are going to be interested.The necklace belongs to Ardis Bellamy's family, and Ardis will do what she can to locate the missing jewelry and get it back into good hands. This won't be so easy, she comes to find out, when Ardis is taken on a wild goose chase of an adventure. She is an art restorer, and thinks the trip to find the necklace should be fairly simple. But the chase is determined to prove her wrong. And who is there to trust? It seems like everyone she meets is deceiving her somehow.On this mission, Ardis meets James Tate. He says he's a stolen goods recovery agent. Ardis wonders if he has an agenda of his own other than helping her. He's there to speak and interpret for her, since she speaks English and not French. But Ardis still can't help but wonder if he's trustworthy.Trail of the Tudor Blue is a mystery and adventure with only a slight amount of romance. Yes, there is a romantic plot weaved in with Ardis and James, but it's on the back burner to the adventure and mystery to the story. Readers only get the story from Ardis's point of view, as this story is written in first person. While the characters are fun and exciting, you don't learn too much about Ardis's past.

Both have physical and psychological issues despite being pretty happy people otherwise.I have to say that I fell for Adam right off. Despite his trauma, he was a good, pretty even-tempered guy. Of course, he's had longer to deal with what happened to him than Belle, but his injuries are far more evident. Belle's attitude, on the other hand, tends to fluctuate. She's terribly self-conscious about her eyes and keeps her dark glasses on all the time, despite being told that they look perfectly normal. They struggle with learning how to deal with each other, and both worry that the other feels more pity than attraction.I loved the potential in the story, but it just screamed for more length. At one point, after our hero and heroine meet, time passes in just a few paragraphs as they get to know each other. I wanted more and nearly screamed in frustration. This story easily could have been novella length, if not longer. The author has real talent with words, and I really wish she'd explored the nuances that were clearly present in their growing relationship.Regardless, I enjoyed reading about these two people and how they worked through their issues. They were well-suited and fit each other in so many ways. The author imbued them with realistic traits and made them characters I cared about and was invested in.

Humans fight to survive; standing against werewolves waiting at their doors. Food is scarce and trust is something that has to be earned.Kate McKinnon knows this all too well. Her ranch, Sanctuary, is exactly as the name implies; a haven for those who need protection from the werewolves that kill without hesitation. Unfortunately, supplies are dwindling and it won't be long before all of those who turn to her are starving. Assistance is offered by Ty Bennett, a man she's maintained radio contact with for years. After she's placed into danger, she has no choice but to accept the bargain he offers. He'll transport her people to safety, but he demands one thing in return - her.Ty Bennett isn't entirely human, and he knows eventually he'll have to tell Kate his secret. Despite his promise to see the people under her care to safety, he also knows he can't keep his hands off the woman he's dreamed about for years. Although she welcomes his touch, his embrace, and everything he has to offer physically, it's her blood he yearns for most.Undeniable has an interesting premise involving werewolves, vampires, and the western frontier. The beginning of the story sets the tone. The heroine, Kate, is strong-willed and determined to protect those under her care. The threat is very real, with werewolves devouring livestock she protects and keeping the people under her roof on the brink of starvation. When Ty arrives to rescue her from an attack by renegades, their chemistry is off the charts. He wants her, she wants him, and it's obvious. Usually this is a good thing in erotic romance, as a hero and heroine who don't deny their attraction to each other heighten anticipation. In this case, however, the lack of character development causes the story to become less about romance, more about sex, and leaves a lot to be desired.Due to the length of the work, the reader is left to question how Ty was made, where he truly comes from, how things work at his compound, and what will happen when he takes Kate to a better, safer place. The reader is quite literally dropped into the story, forced to accept the situation, and is left with a cliffhanger ending that leaves everything open to chance. That being said there are positive aspects to Undeniable. The heat between Kate and Ty is scorching. The intimate scenes between the two sizzle, and the flame doesn't stop burning until the last page is turned. The world Ms. Devlin has created is fascinating and pulls the reader into the story quickly. With witty dialogue and a fast pace, erotic romance enthusiasts will soar through Undeniable in one sitting.Fans of paranormal romance with a western flair and a lot of sexual intensity are sure to enjoy Undeniable. Although many things are not clarified in the first story, perhaps they will be revealed later in the series.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

He has no sympathy for inferior humans, but he feels likes there is something missing. Samara literally slams into his world. She is a pretty little thing and he is instantly drawn to her. As commander of his cyborg team, Lyon is required to be big, strong and detached at all times. His race is in the fight for their lives, but the only thing on his mind is the sweet nurse that he just has to have.Samara Williams sure liked what she saw when she looked at the bound prisoner. Cyborgs have a reputation for being merciless killers, but all she saw was sex on legs. She was raised to be non-judgmental and she refused to believe the man before her was anything like the stories she had heard. She would give him a chance and allow his actions to prove to her that he is worthy of her friendship and trust.From prisoner to captor, Lyon has taken Samara and not because they need medics back at his base. He wants her for himself and he will do anything to keep her. His world comes crashing down when he thinks she has betrayed him. It will take the heart of a human to change the mind of a machine.I was apprehensive at one point that the story would fall into predictability. After a major confrontation between Lyon and Samara, I was afraid that Samara would wither and bend to Lyon's intimidation, but she held her own and she persevered. I enjoyed that she didn't fall back into a quiet timid female persona. She knew she had to be strong and stood up to the rather huge Leo Class cyborg. It was a turning point for me in the story. It was entertaining how she proved herself to Lyon and his crew, making a place for herself in his heart and the whole cyborg community.I was captivated by this story. I hope Ms. Carter continues writing about these characters. The other crewmembers on Lyon's team were intriguing and very interesting. I can see promising futures for them and I hope I can come along for the ride. Ms. Carter writes exciting and enthralling science fiction. She had my heart dropping and soaring all within a few pages. She could easily write a full length novel and keep me totally engaged. Sci-fi is an untapped genre for me and Ms. Carter has my piqued my interest and curiosity.

The characters of Leo and Roxie were engaging, and you really felt a connection to them.

Stuck in St. Nacho's while he rehabs his crushed arm, Daniel can't seem to catch a break. He unintentionally disappoints his newly engaged brother Jake, and Daniel's on-again, off-again animosity with sexy firefighter Cam is a bumpy road. Add in a long lost dying father, more accidents than anyone should handle, and a ton of misunderstandings and the result lands Daniel frequently in the hot seat. He keeps trying to get out of trouble but each attempt only lands him deeper in the mud.Book of Daniel is the fourth book in the St. Nacho's series by ZA Maxfield. Long time fans of the series will definitely want to read this one and any newcomers shouldn't worry because each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone. In fact it almost reads better as such as frequently the characters seem to change from book to book and so reading without those preconceived ideas may actually help. Book four picks up with the story about Daniel and Cam and it's a rocky romance. The romance between the two men runs hot and cold with numerous misunderstandings even as Daniel spends the majority of the book on his knees begging for forgiveness again and again.Unfortunately this doesn't always work as Daniel is painted as a selfish cad, but his actions never quite seem that way. We're told more than shown Daniel's supposed horrible character but I never quite bought into that. Additionally, the story throws in a lot of different plot points. There are simply too many and some don't really make sense with the context of the story. They seem too easy and manufactured. The timeline at the end jumps around wildly without much explanation and includes pretty big leaps in logic that are difficult to follow and furthermore relate to the point of the story.On the positive side, the descriptive quality is pretty high and pure Maxfield. The great St. Nacho's setting that stars so well in each story is on display here and the various secondary characters easily charm once again. The writing is good and very engaging, even if the characters and their romance wasn't as much. I wish the plot had been tighter with a much more linear and cohesive storyline and characterization. This is a good book in the series but not the best. Fans of the series won't want to miss it but newcomers may be better off starting with the real gem of the series, the first book.

Their bond is extremely unique, as is their love. After going through so much already in the two years they've been together, Jin and Logan deserve some peace and quiet. Unfortunately they don't get that yet as someone has kidnapped Jin's best friend which leads to a deadly and incredibly vicious ancient ritual among the werepanthers. Logan, Jin, and their people are about to be tested in so many ways with only their bonds of love, friendship, and loyalty to see them through.Honored Vow is the third book in the Jin/Logan relationship. You technically don't need to read the previous two books as there is so much background thrown into this one the average reader will be able to pick up the plot without much trouble. I wouldn't suggest it though as the world building is chaotic and very confusing. There are so many random terms and concepts thrown in at a breakneck speed it's easy to become confused by the werepanther world. There's a lack of cohesive logic to this fantasy world that would likely bother sticklers for detail. However the action happens along the same speed so those readers who enjoy a lot of lightening fast action may be able to overlook any world building issues.The real highlight of the book is Jin, as always. He's a bit of a perfect character - the most rare, most powerful, most caring - but in this book he actually learns just how much his inflated ego can harm those around him. It's nice to see him actually grow and mature from the spoiled brat he is to understanding the ramifications of his actions. One note of caution is that there is a lot of violence in this book. The werepanther world is incredibly brutal and vicious and death/maiming/torture is pretty common. Most of it happens off page and considering they are panthers, most can heal any major damage. No character seems permanently harmed by their torture or maiming. Combined with the high-speed action, all the violence isn't necessarily something that would turn readers off.Honored Vow is a very quick and mostly entertaining read. It has some questionable plot points due to the messy world building but the characters are adorable and fun to read. Overall this was a fun read. The characters and situations are over the top but the quiet moments of connection and real bonding are what make up the heart of the story. Anyone who's read the series so far will want to continue and although this is Jin and Logan's final book, there are numerous secondary characters who are set up and shine, obviously on the road to their own books.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

There is a great deal of humor in this book, which makes it an enjoyable read.Sports, both human and dragon, are described in complete and exacting detail. I did find it tedious to have Peter&#8217;s field hockey matches (Peter is an avid player), and even the dragon game of Laminium Ball explained play by play. I felt these descriptions slowed the overall pace of the book. Without them, this is a fast-action highly suspenseful book with never a dull moment.

Can this foursome keep it together or is there room to grow?A Man, A Jersey, and a Tight-End is the sequel to Goldilocks and His Three Bears. I'd highly suggest reading the first book before tackling this sequel as the relationships are established in the first book and this one is actually much deeper and more meaningful. In Goldilocks, the two main couples are established - Paul and Brian, Jim and Scott - while the foursome regularly mix it up and have an open policy for everyone, especially Brian. Now those relationships are tested with real life. This story focuses more on the emotional bonds and how to make such unorthodox couplings really work. It still has the same light, playful touch to the sex scenes but the characters feel deeper and more real this time around.Also the issues brought up are more intense. Not all of these issues are well handled. Most are glossed over very easily and quickly, more for the plot point of the issue than the actual resolution. The story does try to bring up more in depth issues than the last book. Additionally there are numerous sex scenes, enough to please any fan. There are almost too many but as always Ms. Riley is an excellent writer so this isn't a bad thing. If anything it keeps the tone playful and light with a lot of rough-housing and enjoyable banter.This is a pretty successful and entertaining sequel, though it's not perfect.

As Dimtri and Elise learn to trust each other, Dimitri's enemy, Kelch, is waiting to pounce. Knowing Kelch and his henchmen could strike at any moment kept me on the edge of my seat. I do have one issue with the plot. I won't spill all the details, but I will say that Dimitri and Elise let their guard down at a very inopportune moment and Kelch manages to gain the upper hand. This situation felt a bit forced, and I found it hard to believe that Dimitri and Elise would be so careless when they knew Kelch was watching them.Despite this issue, Dimtri and Elise's negligence leads up to a climax that's a real nail biter. All this suspense had me flying through the pages so quickly I was able to read the book in one sitting.The secondary characters could have been a bit more rounded, but they did complement Dimitri and Elise nicely as well as keep the plot moving at a great pace. I really would have liked to know a bit more about Kelch. It's clear he and Dimitri have been rivals for most of their lives, but the origin of their feud is a bit murky.

As she comes to know both men with their similarities and striking differences Bridget realizes she's falling for them both equally. Both Mark and Matt also fall under her spell, but are reluctant to let their mutual attraction for Bridget drive a wedge between them. And so the obvious answer is to start a threesome. Although none of them have ever shared partners, the twins and Bridget explore this sensual new relationship blossoming between them.Lighthearted and fun for the most part, this is a sexy, smooth read.

Add to the fact they are your best friends and this is an erotic dream waiting to happen!I know not everyone has a special place in their hearts for an M/F/M encounter, but I think if I had to dream one up, twins would right up there towards the top. Add in sleek sexy athletic forms, two great personalities, and all around nice guys you have a winning scenario!Bobbi adores her two best friends. They have a perfect relationship. She's there for them emotionally, supports their activities and they have wonderful times together. She's also one of the very few people that can tell these two perfect specimens apart. What she can't understand are these budding feelings she's experiencing. Could she secretly want her best friends? Could they want her? It appears the boys have a secret!Tobias and Sebastian are campus gods. Women want them singularly and together, but these men only have time for their sports, education and their best friend, Bobbi. Together they turn an ordinary night into something special. Now Bobbi needs to evaluate her life and their friendship. Tobias and Sebastian have waited this long, they can be patient for a little while longer.This story is written in Bobbi's point of view. While I like single POV stories, it reconfirmed that it's not my favorite form of storytelling. I experienced her feelings, thoughts and conflicts right along with her. I liked her inner dialog, but at times it was rather extensive. Bobbie was going through a major life changing experience and maybe it could have been curtailed a bit, but if you take it in the context of the situation it was understandable. She could recognize what was happening within her, but was unable to stop it. She was battling her brain, body and heart.Bobbi appeared to be a fuller figured woman, though a true vision of her size was never explained. There were references of rude comments made about her size, and her thoughts on it, but again it was vague. She felt basically comfortable with herself, but plain. That was one of her problems. She couldn't comprehend why these two gorgeous men were interested in her. The only clues I got were from their group conversations and those was rather limited.While reading Doubled, there were times I was slightly confused on who or what was going on. But I was so involved with the story at the time, I really didn't care. I did have a few moments of stopping, rereading and evaluating. Yes, it was a bit bothersome at times, but I was so engrossed in the story, I didn't let it stop me.I enjoyed Doubled. It was nice to read a story about people falling in love because of their inner selves and not their outer packaging. Ms. Stein had a great idea, told a sweet sexy story, but there were a few bumps along the way. Truthfully they may be noticeable, but I still enjoyed the story greatly. Nothing beats a book about buddies taking their friendship to the next level.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

Their party is interrupted and Kitty invites the men to go with her and see where the night takes them. Will Kitty find love or will the mens secret ruin it all? Lies always have a way of coming out; will Shane and Noah's be worth it?This story was a hard one for me to get into. We learn quickly on in the book that the men are trying to seduce Kitty and get her to try and sell the family business, which made it hard for me to like them. I found it hard to immerse myself in the romance between the men and Kitty because I continued to think about the men lying to and tricking Kitty. She's a strong woman who is trying to let off some steam after continuously working to save the company day after day.The sex is a hot read and it flows well between the three but the sexual conflict between the two men became a distraction for me. In a way it seemed that they just used Kitty to make their relationship all right. Even with this the three are good together and it was nice to see them develop their relationship. There was a lot of attention paid to the lovemaking and not too much on the actual storyline. I kept waiting for Kitty to find out about the lies but every time a scene would end another one would begin. Somebody always seemed to be having sex or the men were dealing with their own relationship. Even Kitty notices this and gives the men an ultimatum about their relationship.Watching Noah and Shane figure out their relationship was a nice read. The men love each other and begin to have feelings for Kitty but they must find out where their relationship stands before they decide on the relationship that includes all three of them. It was nice to see each man develop a bond with Kitty as well and had me hoping that the three would find a solution to all their problems. Although this book may not a favorite for me, I am a fan of this author and plan to continue reading her work because I know I'll find another book that will be a favorite. If a hot menage with some lovely M/M action and a bit of deception is what you're in the mood for, look no further than Velvet Steel.Originally posted at LAS erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

Zach is a brilliant scientist who has discovered the planet they're living on is about to end. Unfortunately he's having a hard time convincing anyone of his findings; not to mention he just met super cute guy, Adam. Although the timing may be off, Zach takes a chance and convinces Adam to help him save as many people as possible.Higher Ground is an amusing story that reads like a B grade end of the world movie. The main characters have a cute meet, barely get a date in together before they're off trying to save the world and anyone they can find. Well technically the world is beyond saving but the people aren't. Zach and Adam are a likeable couple. They come across as somewhat bland and typical, easy forgettable, but at the same time they're harmless and fun to read. Both are stereotypical cut outs and there is no real angst to their pairing.The drama comes from external sources of the planet blowing up. Unfortunately this is where I had the most problems with the story. It's a decent enough concept, if a familiar one, but the story really struggles in the details. Supposedly this takes place on a distance terra-formed planet of the universe. Except there is almost no world building and not enough details that actually brings that premise to life. Instead, the story reads like a contemporary story with a few novel words and gadgets thrown in here and there. That's not bad for the story itself, but it detracts heavily when the story is billed as science-fiction in space.Overall, Higher Ground is an amusing read with a drama-free main couple and some familiar set ups. The various secondary characters are fun and tend to steal the show from the main couple and the author's writing is very clean and smooth. Perhaps not a story I'd read again but enjoyable and easy to read.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

Instead he finds the ranch is owned and operated by Brady Gaines, his mom Mattie, brother Paul and sister Jaime.Everyone except Jaime welcomes him since his being there means her friend Charity won't be coming back. Charity was the cook before Kyle was hired, but was fired when Brady and Jaime caught her having sex with their brother Paul. As a result, Brady put in a non fraternization policy and hired Kyle because he's married.Jaime resents Kyle's presence and decides she'll seduce him to get him fired and get Charity back. Besides some pretty obvious flaws in her plan it doesn't help that she might be a little bit attracted to Kyle. Then to throw a wrench in Kyle's cover his ex-wife Lana is one of the guests at the ranch.It was fun to see the dynamics between Kyle and the two women unfold, and it made you wonder when Kyle was going to come clean about not being married.

But what would happen if you had the opportunity to find Mr. Right in a different time?Eleanor is trying to enjoy her dream vacation, and with the exception of the boyfriend who abandoned her, she is. Ancient Rome is one of her favorite periods of history, so she struggles to enjoy the sites of the ruins of Rome while coming to terms with a relationship she saw as more than it obviously was.Darius is a Senator in ancient Rome, struggling with the reality of his time. More than anything, he desires a wife, but he refuses to settle for the subservient women of his time. He wants a partner - an equal. Despite his powerful position of senator, he is unhappy with his life and wants more. The problem is; he doesn't know what that more is.The limits of time and place fade away as Madame Eve manages to set up Eleanor with Darius, and with each other, they find the happiness they both lack.This story is a true fantasy, and works best if you try not to over think it as you read. The author does a nice job of setting a picture - from the unhappiness of each character to the environment each lives in, it was easy to create a mental image of what was happening on the page.The connection between Darius and Eleanor was vivid, and I could feel the chemistry they made together. One thing just didn't fit, however. The condoms. I know safe sex is an issue to most people, as it rightfully should be, but seeing as how Eleanor travelled back in time to ancient Rome, the concept of condoms seemed very out of place, especially since it was Darius who wore them, and he hardly questioned what this thing was that Eleanor asked him to wear - even going so far as to remind her later in the evening about them. It was a detail that unfortunately took me out of the story because it seemed to strange.Happily ever after was alluded to, and I really would like to find out how that was accomplished, considering how different the two people were, yet how well they fit with each other. I would love to have this one continue because it feels as if we got the beginnings of a story, but it ended far too quickly.The pros outweighed the cons in this one.

While I did enjoy many aspects of the book, as a whole, the story left me wanting more.Desiree Holt is a very good writer. I have read some of her other titles and always enjoy the way she turns a phrase, and describes the events as they unfold. She creates characters we can root for, and her hero, Hawk Blackwater, and heroine, Riley Scott, were no exceptions. Hawk was intelligent and forthright, and is taken immediately by the nervous Riley. He knows she's hiding something, but is far too terrified to confide in him. When she finally does, the two make a connection which, while fast, is undeniable.The environment of the small town was beautifully set, and I could imagine walking down the streets from one location to another. The mountains were also described wonderfully and added much to the quaint setting of the story.In addition to the positives of the book, there were negatives. The pacing of the story as a whole felt rushed. The beginning gave a recap of backstory, as well as a rundown of the minor characters, including numerous deputies, and it felt a bit 'too much too soon.' It was hard to keep track of who was who, and in a suspense story, I like to keep track of characters in an attempt to figure out whodunit. I did realize shortly thereafter that this was unlike many other mysteries, in that this seemed to be intended as a shorter story, but that meant much of the tale was told by way of telling instead of showing. There were several conversations that were skipped over or told by way of recap, and I felt something was missing because of it.Most of the loose ends were tied up by the end of the book, and despite the rapidness of it, I wasn't left with many questions. The relationship of Hawk and Riley was centerpoint, and they got their happily ever after the way most would want them to.As a short tale, this one was fun to read.

When she's assigned security detail for Beachville's notorious bad boy, her former cop instincts warn her not to get too close, but her duties to protect him demand otherwise. It is when her guard is down with the belief that he couldn't possibly take interest in someone with both physical and emotional scarring that he takes advantage. For someone who is used to relying on her gut instincts, Madison is troubled by what they are telling her to do now - trust the playboy and give in to the demands of her body.Their first meeting is forever seared into Sean's memory as he remembers rescuing a broken Madison from a fire. Her job may have put her in harm's way and his job was to take her out, but the recovery left him wanting the one woman who doesn't want him. Madison may be the only woman capable of seeing the real Sean and there is a curious depth to her that makes him want to know more. Now it's her job to protect him, but Sean is determined to take charge and show her there is more to him than his groupies and she deserves everything he has to offer including his heart.While this story may the second in the Boys of Beachville series, each can be read and enjoyed as a standalone. In this story, a celebrated firefighter meets his match in a former cop. I loved that the female lead was also a uniformed professional and that they take turns essentially rescuing each other on different levels. There is so much potential for a higher level of angst in this story that I couldn't help but feel a bit cheated. The restricting length of the story does a two-fold job of keeping a fast moving pace, but it felt hindering in the character, romance, and plotline development aspects. It was easy to connect with the characters and their situations, but overall I just wanted more and for their journey together not to have been quite so easy.An extremely easy on the eyes read that wasted no time getting to the sexy core of the story. The BDSM theme is only slight in that the heroine's hands were tied, so readers not into hardcore BDSM shouldn't be afraid to give this one a go. There is also a potential exhibitionism scene with a risqu&eacute; roof romp, which was absolutely sinful in the best possible way. The alternating point-of-views is very well done and served to magnify the sexiness.There are more Boys of Beachville yet to discover and I would absolutely recommend this series to erotic romance readers in need of an easy, racy read.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

Once Rach meets Brios, the revelations concerning magic and shape shifters come very quickly. Rach has an incredible amount of information forced on her all at once. At first, Rach is very reluctant to accept the truth about the shape shifters. However, I thought her resistance felt forced. So much in fact that it was really quite comical when Rach tries to convince herself that she is &#8220;dreaming.&#8221; Though I found Rach&#8217;s reactions entertaining, at a certain point, her actions failed to feel realistic, especially when the truth was literally staring her in the face.Rach is very easy to like. She&#8217;s a smart girl with a bit of an attitude who isn&#8217;t about to let anyone push her around. Once Rach fully accepts her gifts, I have no doubt that she is going to be a very powerful leader within the Shalean society.I also really enjoyed Rach&#8217;s budding relationship with Brios. It was clear from the moment they met that they had a strong connection. However, Rach is only fifteen and she knows she is much too young to be making a serious commitment. I admire Brios&#8217; restraint and resolve to take things slowly. He never tries to force anything on her and lets her make her own choices. I truly believe they will be a very powerful team, and I look forward to watching the development of their relationship.I feel that the conflicts in this tale were resolved much too quickly. There are a lot of interesting things going on in this story that I wish had been explored in greater depth. The ending felt rushed to me, especially the part where Rach was told about her history and the fate of her mother. I realize that Rach and Brios were in a difficult situation at the time, but I truly feel that Rach deserves much more than she was given. I hope she has the time to explore her past and new abilities in future installments of this series.Over all, I enjoyed reading Discovered. The world Ms. Lilley has created is interesting and I found the concept of the Shaleans thought provoking.

Devoted to becoming an Ovate, his life is seemingly predestined for loneliness, despite his lingering doubts as to what is right for him. On the eve of the Solstice, his duty is to tend to the fires. He doesn't expect to have company.I thoroughly enjoy the 1Night Stand stories, not only because of the heat level, but because there are wonderful characters and story development in such a few, short pages. Druid, Mine, however, left me wanting a bit more. I could understand the initial connection between the two characters - both were lonely, both lacked family or friends, and both were attracted to the other - but there didn't seem to be much beyond that. To imagine two characters from such dramatically different times and places, I wouldn't discount a relationship working, but there'd have to be a reason for it. Loneliness and attraction isn't enough, particularly when one has to have their world so drastically changed in order to continue together.Ms. Adrienne does have a wonderful way of describing her environment. I know little of the time of the Druids, but the context of her story helped me to catch on quickly as to what was happening. I wasn't clear on all of the things described, but I was able to picture enough to enjoy the story and had a mental picture of where and when the couple was.If I was to review the book based solely on their one night, it was a huge hit.

Tarkan's family and former lover, Caleb, are all informed and rally to find him, having thought him long-dead from the bomb.

He is still haunted and in love withTarkan, but head over heels in love with his new partner, Adem. When Tarkan continues to hide, only Caleb can help bring him back out and into their lives once again.This is the latest book in an ongoing series revolving around Tarkan's family, but it's not strictly necessary to have read the others first. The author does a good job of catching the reader up on the other couples/members though it does slow the pace of the story a bit. I was a bit disappointed that a very large portion of the book was dedicated to these other characters and not the main relationship between Tarkan, Caleb and Adem.Despite this, the characters are extremely likeable and interesting. The bonds between the family members - new and old - are well drawn and it sucks the reader into the story. Written in an easy pace, the connections and love is clearly shown between the various pairings and family members. Still, I would have liked to see more of Tarkan and how he coped with the ramifications of his torture and captivity. The interactions between all the characters was vibrant and some of the scenes heart wrenching.

Even though Jen and Sean initially barely exchange more than a dozen words she's left with a powerful craving for him she can't deny. When he searches her out after the party the simmering passion explodes. Their impulsive action sends shockwaves not only through the media - who are covering the conference/festivities - but also through their businesses.This is a fast paced sexy romp of a book. Revolving around breweries, business competition and the media attention that can surround them, I found the plot different and interesting to read. The chemistry between Jen and Sean is hot and sucks you in immediately. Sean is not your typical alpha-male, though he is determined to have his cake and eat it too. Sean's character is delightfully complex and not entirely what we're first led to believe. Jen is more than a match for him in many respects. These two butt heads and still manage to burn up the sheets, not something that is always balanced properly, but it shines in this book.There's a strong cast of secondary characters, and a few sub-plots intertwined around this. Most noteworthy is Sean's bitchy ex-wife who is a bucket load of trouble, Sean's twin brother, Liam and Jen's brewery partner and off-again/on-again bed buddy, Dylan.

The slow, gradual growth of romantic feelings is a sweet and wonderful thing to read. I found it quite easy to lose myself in the gentle ebb and flow of Lucas and Tessa.Both Lucas and Tessa are middle aged which I found delightfully written and refreshing. I also really enjoyed how the book focused so fully on their blossoming relationship and not their differences, like Tessa being a vegetarian and Lucas a traditional meat and potatoes man. Initially Tessa is a bit skittish, but Lucas shows an abundance of patience. This is a sweetly sensual book about two people who's lives have diverged but fate gives them a second chance together.While there are a few subplots, the real spotlight is on the characterizations and interactions predominantly between Lucas and Tessa.

The only problem is that Mari&#8217;s spit fire personality, and the fact that she may be viewed as an outsider, definitely stacked the cards against their relationship and happiness.All three characters in this story are so headstrong and have their own ideas of what they want, that they can sometimes forget about each other&#8217;s needs. This character flaw really makes the storyline intriguing. While at times it may seem selfish, it is easy to see that Ethan, Gabriel, and Mari have the best intentions, they just don&#8217;t always know how to show it.While I absolutely adore Ethan and Gabriel as a package at times I found it difficult to differentiate from the two. While they have different looks, their personalities just seem a little too similar, which sometimes left me confused. After a while I was able to pick up on differences that helped me figure them out and follow the story thread better, especially once they began to discover their feelings and when the other Colony members got involved.The conflict with the colony really helped to heighten the tension. The fact that some supported the relationship while others did not reminded me of some of my own personal situations. Especially because there was unseen opposition as well as allies around various corners. It added a certain danger or anticipation to the story that helped to increase my emotional connection. There are some extremely prejudiced views toward Mari. Since she is considered an outsider by many so, if a reader is offended by prejudice and hate towards people for no other reason by who they were born as they may find certain aspects of this story offensive.In the end I think that the story really had some remarkable ups and downs which created a propelling plot line.

The descriptions and details made me envision the setting, feel the character emotions, and want to know what happened next.My one and only complaint is that Jack was too passive. I understand the author was trying to paint him as a man reluctant to open his heart to love and desire because of losing the love of his life, but at times he came off more like a reluctant five year old refusing to eat his veggies. There were scenes when he was strong and made the first move, like when he came to check on Hope's sister or when he invited them to his place, but when it came to the sex he was a scared kitten. There was a scene where Hope is giving him oral sex and his hands are bunched into fists and he refuses to touch her. That turned me off. I like a man who enjoys sex and is actively participating in it. His lack of participation and his fear didn't sit well with me in that one scene.The rest of the story was good, and I enjoyed how in the end he got over his fear.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

From early on, people misunderstood her and judged her by the actions of her stepfather. They thought she was trouble and either kept their distance while whispering bad things about her behind her back or boys only wanted to get in her pants because they thought she was easy. She was a loner, but not by choice. Except there was one cowboy who refused to leave her alone even after she refused him. After finally giving in to his charms, Zuri started realizing that with him is where she belonged, but she was unsure if he felt the same. On a day that should have otherwise been a happy one for a couple of teenagers in love, Zuri finally receives the answer she'd been waiting for. Now it's been twelve years since she last saw Colt Triplehorn, but their reunion may be too little too late.Colt's future changed dramatically the day Zuri walked out of his life. The hopeful young man he was grew up into the hardened sheriff he is now. Although he hasn't seen her in a long time, Zuri still influences his life. From his mood right down to his sex life, or lack thereof, and even his brothers have taken notice. It's Colt's job to maintain order in the small town of Caldera and work the family ranch, but there's something missing in his orderly life. That something appears one-day butt naked and bringing a whirlwind of trouble with her except this time, they are playing by Colt's rules. Too many misunderstandings and hurt feelings still stand in the way, but their physical attraction and chemistry is undeniable. Colt will get his answers and Zuri will get hers, but at what cost when a robbery, a stalker, and mistrust all stand in the way?This first in The TripleHorn Brand series, is fun, fast paced, and full of cowboy goodness! It was great to read the heroine taking the troublemaking lead in the story and give the hero a run for his money in getting her out of it. I figured that with how Zuri grew up she would be a bit harder and much more independent especially when it came to her reunion with Colt, maybe even make him work for it a little more, but that just wasn't the case. They both have things to atone for in their relationship, but Zuri almost immediately hands over control to him and that I just couldn't connect with. The history on their individual backgrounds and relationship is somewhat sparse, but eventually came together by the end. I was looking forward to reading more about Colt's brothers, but not much is given on them, which of course has me searching out the next in the series.Although each of the scenes ended somewhat abruptly, the story kept right on progressing and made it engaging to read. The sex scenes are plentiful and vital to the emotional growth of the couple, but also extremely steamy and well worth the read. I would definitely recommend this to fans of alpha male cowboys with big appetites in and out of the bedroom!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",

Master Lucas has entered the building and all Hell is about to break loose.The angle of the bratty sub was done pretty well, but I found myself getting annoyed with how mouthy Ann was toward Lucas. Being in a BDSM situation, you must have a certain kind of personality that invites public display of the body and sexual activities. That is why you go to a club. Ann balked at every step and gave absolute Hell to every Master she encountered, including Master Lucas. As the events progressed, you could see she wanted to trust him but the constant whining made me want to stuff a gag in her mouth myself.The tension in Retraining the Sub was well done. The trust and abandonment issues were prevalent and you could see how early events in the book shaped the character growth of Lucas and Ann. The fact that they both ended up at the same club trying to work out their issues was interesting, as were the exercises Lucas put Ann through to strengthen her skills as a sub. Ann's overall journey was harrowing, but I wanted to hear less complaining. The dialogue was strong and the sex scenes were terrific. Writer Jennifer Denys did an excellent job of expressing to the reader exactly what was taking place, especially in the m&eacute;nage scene.The cover art on this book was absolutely yummy. Master Lucas clad in leather pants, a studded belt and a single tail whip was sexy and made me want to read this book before I even knew what it was about. Sour Cherry Designs did a superb job.If bratty subs and the Doms that tame them are your game, then Retraining the Sub will be right up your alley.Originally posted at LAS ERotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText='Nicole Harrison can&#8217;t help but be impressed when Sebastian Clark sits next to her at the bar. She&#8217;s had a horrid day and just wants to sit and enjoy a stiff drink, catch her breath and have a few minutes of solitude. But Sebastian manages not only to make her laugh, but pique her interest. He&#8217;s clearly more than willing for a quick fling, but doesn&#8217;t appear desperate or even on the prowl. After a pleasant evening of bantering, what was supposed to be a single kiss turned inexplicably for them both into a heated night of raunchy sex. One night turns into the weekend, as they both cross boundaries and become more intrigued and interested in each other.This book is scorching hot, with plenty of explicit sex and dirty talk. The ending was satisfying, but not a traditional happily ever after. Romantic readers who need a definitive, solid &#8220;happy ending&#8221; might want to be prepared for a different style of resolution to the coupling. I found there was plenty of emotional connection between Nicole and Sebastian and it was very realistic &#8211; no swooning heroine or over the top hero. Both dedicated, career driven people our protagonists are modern and more than willing to share a weekend of being lovers and giving themselves completely over to each other. For a steamy read, this fits the bill and will get your blood pumping.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews', tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText=\"What do you do when you want to marry for love and your family fights you every step of the way? You leave.The story line of the book was interesting. Written as a trilogy, it had definite parts. The first book, Breaking Free takes us from the lap of luxury into the waiting arms of Jordan, a local coffee house and BDSM club owner. The dialog was a bit off and the action choppy. I also had trouble with the suspension of disbelief at the coffee house when Claire gets in trouble for not being a good barista and ends up down in the dungeon having sex and taking over 40% of the company. It was too fast.In the second part of the book, San Francisco Breeze, the flow was much better. The sex was sizzling and the events of the book were more orderly. The detail was very intense and the scenes were electrifying. The involvement of Claire in the business end of the coffee house takes on a smoother ride. She and Jordan come up with a great name for the coffee house with drinks named for BDSM signature flavors. It made me laugh and I was back to being hooked again. The blend of coffee house, sex club scenes and private moments made this segment my favorite of the three. It held my interest, felt realistic and had a good story line.The third part of the book Body and Soul takes on yet another twist. Claire experiences new sensations and must decide if she is going to remain with Jordan or help her family who needs her. This section was full of angst and the author did a good job of relating that. The story wavered again, however, as Claire encounters another man and immediately falls into bed with him. This felt a little off. As the story concluded, it went back to full speed and was fine, but I had a lingering sensation that it was more 2-D than 3-D and I wanted more character depth and emotion.Overall, the story line was interesting and the premise worthwhile. The sex scenes were sizzling and the author's grasp on BDSM was good. What I had trouble with were some of the scenarios. Whatever choices made in the story need to have a good foundation and dealing with the dynamics of BDSM, you have to keep showing character depth and how it affects the person emotionally. Okay, maybe not always, but in a coming into yourself tale like this, it helps the reader connect on a more intimate level. Moving from errant barista to business owner and sex slave all at once was a tough nut to crack. In the second book, emotion was well done, but in the first and third, more definition would have been helpful. A little more lead in would have made the difference. I did enjoy the coffee house play on BDSM. Having worked as a barista, I could totally see it and that was my favorite part about the book.If you enjoy a BDSM novel with a bit of coffee house flair, then give this one a try.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText='Nigel thought he&#8217;d completed his bucket list, but he forgot &#8220;fall in love&#8221; was the most important. At forty, Nigel Gasp figured his life was pretty much over. He&#8217;d done everything he could think of, and probably more he never should have attempted, he&#8217;d accomplished everything professionally he could ever dream about and he assumed it was time to go out in a blaze of glory. He didn&#8217;t count on a military vet and his family disrupting Nigel&#8217;s plans and his very life. Jeff and his overbearing but loving family would change the very person Nigel had always presented to the world. However, Nigel Gasp wasn&#8217;t succumbing without a fight.Gasp! is a fun rock star themed story. It stars Nigel Gasp as an almost forty rocker who figures he has nothing left in the world to want, do, or need. He forgot he&#8217;d never really been in love. Enter Jeff, a recently out of the military veteran trying to find his place in the world again. The two are like oil and water to start but soon find out their attraction is mutual. They ease the world weariness in each other. They offer comfort and strength in the most unusual places. The two men may seem like total opposites but they compliment each other even as they butt heads. Since they both have strong personalities their love won&#8217;t be easy and that&#8217;s definitely tested within the bounds of the story.The characters get more and more interesting as the story progresses. They make mistakes and struggle but it makes their eventual happy ending more satisfying. I like that Jeff and his family allows Nigel to really belong and experience a new kind of family and love. Nigel does a bit of cross-dressing but it&#8217;s a relatively minor point and it does add to the complexity of the character. I think the twist (though it&#8217;s not much of a twist) about the sister&#8217;s baby is interesting. I wasn&#8217;t sure why the couple would make that choice in regards to Nigel considering his actions and personality at the time. Likewise I wasn&#8217;t sure why Jeff would insist on some of the choices he does. His reasons make sense but he comes across as inflexible and unwilling to make any compromises.These are minor issues though as the romance between Nigel and Jeff is littered with small laughs and quiet moments. It&#8217;s more intimate than you&#8217;d expect given Nigel&#8217;s profession. The writing does a great job of showing how two very different men fit together so seamlessly. The story does stumble in a few places but I found there to be more things I liked about it than disliked. It&#8217;s a story that makes you want to keep turning the pages to figure out how they&#8217;ll be happy. For fans of the author, I think most will quite enjoy this one. For anyone new, it&#8217;s a great entry into the writing style and tone of this author.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews', tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText=\"What do you do when your fantasy has become so distracting, it has practically taken over your life? Well, you can arrange a 1Night Stand with a lookalike to the man of your dreams. That will get it out of your system. Right?Regina Marshall is a successful marketing executive. Her biggest struggle? She seems obsessed with her assistant-to the point she is distracted at work. He's been fantastic for business and she's terrified to lose him, so in order to relieve her frustrations, she contacts Madame Eve and asks for a clone of her assistant in the hopes she'll get over him once and for all.Gabriel is Regina's assistant and the object of her fantasy. Short of being good at his job and very good looking, we're told little else of Gabriel.There were many good aspects to this story. I enjoyed the progression of the relationship and the gradual wearing away of resistance. Regina is a very strong woman, determined to be in control at all times. Watching her learn that's not possible was intriguing. The sex, of course, was very hot and the way Gabriel broke through Regina's defenses was steamy and sweet at the same time.There were also some negatives which kept me from fully investing myself in the book. It was told solely through Regina's point of view, which is not necessarily bad, but I didn't feel I got to know much about Gabriel because of it. Regina was hard for me to like, since it seemed she was not very good at her job and I got the impression she took credit for work Gabriel may have been responsible for.Because of the limited number of pages, there were glimpses of back story, explaining Regina's hesitancy, but I didn't get much of a feel of the relationship between Regina and Gabriel prior to the 1Night Stand-other than a working relationship. Regina was sexually attracted to Gabriel, that was obvious, but there seemed to be little beyond the physical. And because we didn't get any of Gabriel's point of view, I am not sure what his thoughts were before he discovered Regina's fantasy.I enjoyed the story as a whole. Despite its shortfalls, for a short, hot one night stand, this one hits the spot.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText=\"Sometimes it's the help you need, not necessarily the help you want. Truman is trying to get through college with his head down and focus on his classes and athletics. He has nowhere else to live so he puts on the faade and lives in a very macho frat on campus. The last thing Truman thinks he wants is a stubborn, gorgeous, openly gay Greek that won't leave him alone. Stasi knows a good man when he sees it and he sees beyond the image Truman puts up to the needy, alone man beneath. Determined to give him what he wants and needs, Stasi never gives up despite Truman's many protests. But finally winning Truman isn't enough.Your Biggest Fan, is a fun start  to a new series by Welsh. I'm not sure if the focus will be this one couple as there are numerous secondary couples that could be featured in upcoming novels. In this particular book, Truman and Stasi are the main couple. They're opposites but manage to find common ground. Truman is a closeted jock with a cross-dressing kink. After a bad incident in this past, Truman is literally terrified of anyone finding out about his secret. Stasi isn't fazed though and handles all revelations pretty well and with ease. Together the two men are nicely described and feel genuine. They have the same flaws and fears of young men just out of high school.The book tackles the concept of cross-dressing and its perception in a semi-successful way. On the one hand, it shows how some see this as a kink and a turn on while others find it even worse than just being gay. The various characters in the book tend to be overly supportive and fine with Truman's secrets while there is one lone antagonist that is easily overcome. This is the part of the book where it lost me as it just seemed too fast and too easy. A week or two having sex on the sly with Stasi and suddenly the entire world is accepting of Truman and his cross-dressing. It makes for a nice resolution and a very happy ending for two deserving young men, but didn't feel exactly realistic or authentic.Your Biggest Fan is a nice introduction to a new world. The various other men introduced will likely star on their own or appear again and it makes a warm, enticing atmosphere. It may not be the most realistic or true to life but at the same time it's the kind of Greek life that really should exist. Perhaps it's a utopia, but I don't think readers will mind visiting.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews\", tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
       " Row(reviewText='Maya Deleina creates a descriptive tale in this journey between reality and fantasy.  Luna Kalen seems displaced and in a state of limbo from a prior car accident. While Luna is out on her secluded early morning stroll along the beach, curiosity gets the best of her and she ventures into a near by cave. What Luna finds in the cave will alter life as she knows it. All that she thought was a fantasy can turn out to be real. Or it could be the other way around.Luna is a graphic design artist that just received great news from Renny Morgan, a author of a soon to be released vampire book. While driving to their destination the fog starts to roll in. Chapter one opens with Luna strolling along the shoreline just before sunrise, in her therapeutic ritual after the car accident. On this particular morning Luna&#8217;s interest is piqued by the caves near by that she has heard so much about. As she ventures into the cave she has a suspicion that someone is in there. She finds a dirty, nude mystery man. She allows the man to follow her to her bed and breakfast to clean up. Along the way she notices how handsome the mysterious man is.Between Luna&#8217;s undiagnosed black outs and the unprotected rush to have sex with the handsome stranger I was left with a reminded that yes this is truly fantasy. This author has a talent for extraordinary details. The steamy sex scenes were visually appealing. At this point I was curious as to where the plot was headed. I kept reading to find out where the mystery would lead and would the plot pick up.The introduction to the vampires were very descriptive and quite spooky. At times the details were gruesome as would be expected with a vampire novel. Something was missing in the plot of the vampire origination. Personally, it opened a lot of questions that didn&#8217;t seem to be answered. Characters were popping up out of the blue. At one point I was wondering if this was a sequel to a previous book. Maybe it was due to the fact that the vampire characters were briefly mentioned without much details or description to really get to know them. Although I know this is a work of fantasy, the author&#8217;s vampire section didn&#8217;t make much sense. I wanted to feel the vampire as something that could be believed as real. This wasn&#8217;t the case in this novel. The author&#8217;s approach was different and interesting so therefore I kept reading because I was interested in how this all was going to play out.I thoroughly enjoyed the author&#8217;s writing style. She has a style that gives you enough details that the description of the surrounding elements make you feel you are there in the scenes. For a book to have very few characters, the author left little room to create in-depth character description. I didn&#8217;t connect with the characters, nor did I get a visual of how the characters would look. It was as if they only had names.The brief epilogue did reveal the twist and helped clear up the cliff hanger left in the prologue. Overall the book is a nice combo of fantasy, sex and suspension.If you enjoy a hot and steamy descriptive quick read, I definitely would recommend this book.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews', tone_overall=0.0, tone_TB=1.0, tone_VA=1.0),\n",
